	<P STYLE="font-size:15.5pt;text-align:center;margin-top:34pt;">The Image of 
	the Divine Mercy</P>

	<P>[February 22, 1931] &quot;In the evening, when I was in my cell, I saw the Lord 
	Jesus clothed in a white garment. One hand [was] raised in the gesture of blessing, 
	the other was touching the garment at the breast. From beneath the garment, 
	slightly drawn aside at the breast, there were emanating two large rays, one 
	red, the other pale. In silence I kept my gaze fixed on the Lord; my soul was 
	struck with awe, but also with great joy. After a while, Jesus said to me,
	<FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">Paint an image according to the pattern you see, with 
	the signature: Jesus, I trust in You. I desire that this image be venerated, 
	first in your chapel, and</FONT> [then] <FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">throughout the 
	world.&quot;</FONT> (Diary of St. Faustina, 47)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;I promise that the soul that will venerate this image 
	will not perish. I also promise victory over</FONT> [its]
	<FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">enemies already here on earth, especially at the hour 
	of death. I Myself will defend it as My own glory.&quot;</FONT> (48)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;I desire that there be a Feast of Mercy. I want this 
	image, which you will paint with a brush, to be solemnly blessed on the first 
	Sunday after Easter; that Sunday is to be the Feast of Mercy.&quot;</FONT> (49)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;The two rays denote Blood and Water. The pale ray 
	stands for the Water which makes souls righteous. The red ray stands for the 
	Blood which is the life of souls...<BR>
	These two rays issued forth from the very depths of My tender mercy when My 
	agonized Heart was opened by a lance on the Cross.<BR>
	These rays shield souls from the wrath of My Father. Happy is the one who will 
	dwell in their shelter, for the just hand of God shall not lay hold of him.&quot;</FONT> 
	(299)</P>

	<P>&quot;Once, when I was visiting the artist [Eugene Kazimirowski] who was painting 
	the image, and saw that it was not as beautiful as Jesus is, I felt very sad 
	about it, but I hid this deep in my heart. When we had left the artist&#39;s house, 
	Mother Superior [Irene] stayed in town to attend to some matters while I returned 
	home alone. I went immediately to the chapel and wept a good deal. I said to 
	the Lord, &quot;Who will paint You as beautiful as You are?&quot; Then I heard these words:
	<FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">Not in the beauty of the color, nor of the brush lies 
	the greatness of this image, but in My grace.&quot;</FONT> (313)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;I am offering people a vessel with which they are 
	to keep coming for graces to the fountain of mercy. That vessel is this image 
	with the signature: &quot;Jesus, I trust in You.&quot;</FONT> (327)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;I want the image to be solemnly blessed on the first 
	Sunday after Easter, and I want it to be venerated publicly so that every soul 
	may know about it.&quot;</FONT> (341)</P>

	<P STYLE="font-size:15.5pt;text-align:center;margin-top:39pt;">The Feast of 
	Mercy</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;I desire that the first Sunday after Easter be the 
	Feast of Mercy.&quot;</FONT> (299)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;Ask of my faithful servant</FONT> [Father Sopocko]
	<FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">that, on this day, he tell the whole world of My great 
	mercy; that whoever approaches the Fount of Life on this day will be granted 
	complete remission of sins and punishment.<BR>
	Mankind will not have peace until it turns with trust to My mercy.&quot;</FONT> (300)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;No soul will be justified until it turns with confidence 
	to My mercy, and this is why the first Sunday after Easter is to be the Feast 
	of Mercy. On that day, priests are to tell everyone about My great and unfathomable 
	mercy. I am making you the administrator of My mercy. Tell the confessor that 
	the Image is to be on view in the church and not within the enclosure in that 
	convent. By means of this Image I shall be granting many graces to souls; so 
	let every soul have access to it.&quot;</FONT> (570)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;I desire that the Feast of Mercy be a refuge and shelter 
	for all souls, and especially for poor sinners. On that day the very depths 
	of My tender mercy are open. I pour out a whole ocean of graces upon those souls 
	who approach the fount of My mercy. The soul that will go to Confession and 
	receive Holy Communion shall obtain complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. 
	On that day all the divine floodgates through which grace flow are opened. Let 
	no soul fear to draw near to Me, even though its sins be as scarlet.&quot;</FONT> 
	(699)</P>

	<P STYLE="font-size:15.5pt;text-align:center;margin-top:39pt;">The Chaplet of 
	the Divine Mercy</P>

	<P STYLE="text-align:center;padding-right:22pt;padding-left:22pt;">Dictated 
	by Jesus as a prayer of atonement and for the appeasement of God&#39;s wrath.</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;First of all, you will say one OUR FATHER and HAIL 
	MARY and the I BELIEVE IN GOD. Then on the OUR FATHER beads you will say the 
	following words: &quot;Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity 
	of Your dearly beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins 
	and those of the whole world.&quot; On the HAIL MARY beads you will say the following 
	words: &quot;For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the whole 
	world.&quot; In conclusion, three times you will recite these words: &quot;Holy God, Holy 
	Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.&quot;</FONT> 
	(476)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;The souls that say this chaplet will be embraced by 
	My mercy during their lifetime and especially at the hour of their death.&quot;</FONT> 
	(754)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;At the hour of their death, I defend as My own glory 
	every soul that will say this chaplet; or when others say it for a dying person, 
	the indulgence is the same.&quot;</FONT> (811)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;Oh, what great graces I will grant to souls who say 
	this chaplet; the very depths of My tender mercy are stirred for the sake of 
	those who say the chaplet.&quot;</FONT> (848)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;Write that when they say this chaplet in the presence 
	of the dying, I will stand between My Father and the dying person, not as the 
	just Judge but as the merciful Savior.&quot;</FONT> (1541)</P>

	<P>&quot;When I entered the chapel for a moment, the Lord said to me,
	<FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">My daughter, help Me to save a certain dying sinner. Say 
	the chaplet that I have taught you for him.</FONT> When I began to say the chaplet, 
	I saw the man dying in the midst of terrible torment and struggle. His Guardian 
	Angel was defending him, but he was, as it were, powerless against the enormity 
	of the soul&#39;s misery. A multitude of devils was waiting for the soul. But while 
	I was saying the chaplet, I saw Jesus just as He is depicted in the image. The 
	rays which issued from Jesus&#39; Heart enveloped the sick man, and the powers of 
	darkness fled in panic. The sick man peacefully breathed his last. When I came 
	to myself, I understood how very important the chaplet was for the dying. It 
	appeases the anger of God.&quot; (1565)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;Pray as much as you can for the dying. By your entreaties, 
	obtain for them trust in My mercy, because they have most need of trust, and 
	have it the least. Be assured that the grace of eternal salvation for certain 
	souls in their final moment depends on your prayer.&quot;</FONT> (1777)</P>

	<P STYLE="font-size:15.5pt;text-align:center;margin-top:39pt;">The Hour of Great 
	Mercy</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;At three o&#39;clock, implore My mercy, especially for 
	sinners; and, if only for a brief moment, immerse yourself in My Passion, particularly 
	in My abandonment at the moment of agony. This is the hour of great mercy for 
	the whole world. I will allow you to enter into My mortal sorrow. In this hour, 
	I will refuse nothing to the soul that makes a request of Me in virtue of My 
	Passion.&quot;</FONT> (1320)</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;I remind you, My daughter, that as often as you hear 
	the clock strike the third hour, immerse yourself completely in My mercy, adoring 
	and glorifying it; invoke its omnipotence for the whole world, and particularly 
	for poor sinners; for at that moment mercy was opened wide for every soul. In 
	this hour you can obtain everything for yourself and for others for the asking; 
	it was the hour of grace for the whole world – mercy triumphed over justice.&quot;</FONT> 
	(1572)</P>

	<P STYLE="font-size:15.5pt;text-align:center;margin-top:39pt;">Conversion Prayer</P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;I desire that you know more profoundly the love that 
	burns in My Heart for souls, and you will understand this when you meditate 
	upon My Passion. Call upon My mercy on behalf of sinners; I desire their salvation. 
	When you say this prayer, with a contrite heart and with faith on behalf of 
	some sinner, I will give him the grace of conversion. This is the prayer:</FONT></P>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#F5DEB3">&quot;O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart 
	of Jesus as a fount of Mercy for us, I trust in You.&quot;</FONT> (186, 187)</P>
